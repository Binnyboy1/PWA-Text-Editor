# PWA Text Editor

## Description

This is the 'Module 19' challenge assignment for the UCF coding bootcamp.

We were tasked with creating a web application that functions as a text editor. This project gave us practice with using the IndexedDB database for storage as well as components that allow our application to work as a Progressive Web Application (PWA).

## Installation

1. Git clone repo into VSCode
2. Right click `Develop` folder within the `PAW-Text-Editor` folder and select `Open in Integrated Terminal`
3. Then you can run `npm run install` to complete the installation

```
npm run install
```

## Usage

In the terminal, run `npm start` to start up the project.

```
npm start
```
